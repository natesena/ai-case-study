## Business Activities

- What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

They are a lead generation and marketing product. The product allows people to easily build lists of contacts. The product combines web scraping and AI to allow users to both find contacts and build personalized generative outreach. From the website: "build Leads, enrich leads, use AI to write emails".

- Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The company website says their product is used to "book more meetings". On their website, they list their customers which appear to be other businesses. Basically for outbound marketing.

- What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

It can be very time consuming to get good data to put into your CRM. When you are doing very large campaigns and volume matters, you will want to cast a wide net. Getting high response numbers usually can require really accurate personalization. Clay's AI agents or "Claygents" allow the AI to find relevant recent news about the company and individual news to seem authentic and increase this response rate.
They get information from 50+ data sources and 10 "built in sources", 150 " providers". You can then update your CRM.

- Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

All of their data providers are either integrated via AI search or via APIs from the associated companies. The AI technology for researching may come from OpenAI, but it may also be developed in house, but this is inconclusive.
