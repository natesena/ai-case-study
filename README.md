# Module 1 Challenge: Clay.com Case Study

## Introduction

Clay is a Brooklyn based SAAS company that uses the power of AI to help build out CRMs and send personalized outreach. Clay has seed funding from boldstart ventures and 2 other investors, but other funding information is not publicly available. With customers in pricing tiers starting at $149, it can be assumed they have some amount of revenue.

While companies that aggregate data have existed for quite some time, the integration of AI and particularly AI agents has largely impacted this space. With AI transforming the level of effort, skill, and time required to complete tasks, Clay has deeply integrated it into its product offering to great effect.

## Background

Clay was founded in 2014 by CEO Kareem Amin and CoFounder Nicolae Rusan. Prior to starting Clay, Kareem and Nicolae both studied at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Kareem earned a bachelors in physics and electrical engineering while Nicolae got degrees in economics, political science, and computer science. both Nicolae and Kareem spent time working for Microsoft and Sailthru prior to starting Clay. They both currently reside in Brooklyn while Nicolae currently is focusing on his next venture, Toolkit AI.

The idea for Clay came about as a response to the realization that most tools that store data for professional use, and the most common being a spreadsheet, is "blissfully unaware of the kind of data that they store. Columns think in terms of strings and numbers"<sup>4</sup>. The basis for the creation of Clay would be to make sense of all this data, structured or not.

## Problem Statement

Clay is approaching three main problems: data entry at scale, semantic understanding of unstructured data, and personalization of messaging.

### Data Entry at Scale

In the CRM space, data is largely input into spreadsheets or databases
by humans or data aggregators. This is a very manual process which typically can only be facilitated by data aggregators which are not robust with the results they can produce from limited input queries.

### Semantic Understanding

While data aggregators can alieve some of the difficulty with inputting data into spreadsheets and databases, they are very rudimentary in their function and may have very limited types of data to contribute. They also often rely on private databases which means if a particular aggregator is missing some of the desired data, it may not be able to assist in the data entry. This issue is largely worsened by the absence of semantic understanding of the data itself. Essentially, data aggregators are often limited to understanding the value of column headers like "email" or "name" for which a direct string match can be used to look up further data. This limited understanding of what the data should be makes it very difficult to understand what is missing.

### Personalization of Messaging

In the world of prospecting and customer outreach, getting a response can be extremely difficult and is largely be predicated on relevance and specificity to the target. The specific information needed to capture the reader's attention can take a long amount of time to assemble, often requiring looking up news articles, visiting a company website, and scouring other sources like LinkedIn.

## Objectives

As a lead generation and marketing product, Clay aims to simplify the task of prospecting. Valuable metrics for this would include open or response rates of their messages, and also increasing volume of messages sent while decreasing the time spent to send these messages.

## Methodology

Clay's product combines web scraping and AI to allow users to both find contacts and build personalized generative outreach. From the website: "build leads, enrich leads, use AI to write emails"<sup>6</sup>. Their features allow customers to fill in their CRMs and create personalized outreach at scale.

## Analysis

- Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The company website says their product is used to "book more meetings". On their website, they list their customers which appear to be other businesses. Basically for outbound marketing.

- What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

They do really well at integrating "unstructured data". - https://refactoring.fm/p/clay

"What is different about Clay is that such mappings are public, so other people can reuse them and no one has to write the same scraper twice." - https://refactoring.fm/p/clay

It can be very time consuming to get good data to put into your CRM. When you are doing very large campaigns and volume matters, you will want to cast a wide net. Getting high response numbers usually can require really accurate personalization. Clay's AI agents or "Claygents" allow the AI to find relevant recent news about the company and individual news to seem authentic and increase this response rate.
They get information from 50+ data sources and 10 "built in sources", 150 " providers". You can then update your CRM.

- Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

All of their data providers are either integrated via AI search or via APIs from the associated companies. The AI technology for researching may come from OpenAI, but it may also be developed in house, but this is inconclusive.

## Landscape

- What field is the company in?

The company focuses on providing outbound marketing tools for B2B clients.

- What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

Adding programatic elements to outbound marketing has consistently always been developing. From personal experience, email "drip" softwares that have used programatic messaging have been around for a while. With more data providers and scrapers out there, there has been greater ability to find data to add into CRM systems. This data has also been able to be utilized for personalized outreach in more rudimetary ways.

- What are the other major companies in this field?

There are truly hundreds, if not thousands of companies in this space, so it is large and saturated.

## Methodology:

Describe the methods used to collect data and analyze the information.
Explain why specific methodologies were chosen and their relevance to the case study.

Clay integrates both ChatGPT and "Claygents"<sup>6</sup> into their product which allows for hyper-personalized outreach. While the structured data like names and emails is easy to push into any messaging, personalization at scale is hard. ChatGPT solves the problem of hand writing each message, while their "Claygents" ease the work of finding unstructured data that improves relevance. Common examples of this unstructured data can be news articles from Google, blog posts on their website, and more.

## Results

- What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Based off of a Crunchbase profile, it looks like they have been profitable for sometime, and considering the size of the company, they likely make millions in annual revenue. ==They are featured on some lists of important companies==. The about section has a "clay in the news" spot that

- What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

A SAAS company like this would be gauging their success based on ARR/MRR,# of users/subscribers.There is no public data on this available.

- How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

There is no public data available on this, but it is clear the company continues to grow based off of employment numbers available on Linkedin.

## Recommendations

- If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I personally want to use this tool to do email outreach to get a job by emailing recruitors. Currently, all of their subscriptions are fairly expensive starting at $150/month. This might not be a good value for someone that is not using this to generate new business.

- Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Having a lower tier would allow them to service a new audience of individuals. Considering they already have "playbooks" for CRM automations that could get data valuable for an individual like myself who m ay want to talk to recruitors, I could see this product being of value to others.

- What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

It would not require any new technologies, but there could be new prompts that enable new workflows that woud be valuable to this new userbase. As an example, on Clay's youtube channel, they show how to scrape for companies that have open positions and can allow users to get recruitor emails.

- Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Allowing individuals ot easily get recruitor info would allow them to more easily get in touch with recruitors and get their emails.

"We built our own tech for rate-limiting, timeouts, and caching. We use Redis as a dedicated database for real-time interactions, and store this information later on to Postgres." , "Integrations are implemented as independent packages and run as isolated lambda functions. This allows a separate customer engineering team to add and change integrations even if they have less experience and at a faster pace, without risking a bug that affects the whole system."- https://refactoring.fm/p/clay

With its customer base largely those who prospect or are in sales, their tools allow users to easily aggregate unstructured data hidden across the web. Traditionally, this process is very labor intensive, requiring users to search the web for each data point and then
validate it by hand.
